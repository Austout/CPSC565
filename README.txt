 * The following project is the implementation component
 * to a semester long project. For an overview and explination
 * of each component please read the accompinying paper titled

 * most of the setup code for LWJGL in this was adapted from:
 * https://www.lwjgl.org/guide
 
To run the following project either compile the .java files by hand (painful),
import the project into eclipse, or switch eclipses workspace to this directory.

To switch workspaces open eclipse and click File->switch workspace.
then hit browse and select the folder called 
"AUSTIN_EATON_CPSC565" (parent folder of this document).

To run open the main file located at src/leveldisplay/main.java and
press the run button.

WARNING: if you import the eclipse file rather than switching workspaces
you may have to manually configure LWJGL again (i.e. all of the file paths and such)
which is painful.
may also require a version of eclipse newer than oxygen 2, (december release)
